                <h4>My first project as developer</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>After completed my first semester at college I decided to create my first webpage using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

            <p>After that day I decided to continue my path as software Engineer, so I continue learning more technologies.</p>

            <p>From this point I learn that is necessary to know that we could learn from each other, and that teamwork is important to success.</p>

        <p>My main goal is to continue my learning by completing my studies as a software engineer and of course continuing to learn new technologies.</p>
