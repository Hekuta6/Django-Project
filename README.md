# Overview

On this project my main goal was to create a portafolio resume website using Django.

To run the server is necessary to type on the powershell python manage.py runserver this will display a link for a local host that will include our website.

The purpose of my code is to demostrate how Django can be use to create web applications and how by using Django I was able to create my personal portafolio.
