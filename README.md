# Overview

On this project my main goal was to create a portafolio resume website using Django.

To run the server is necessary to type on the powershell python manage.py runserver this will display a link for a local host that will include our website.

The purpose of my code is to demonstrate how Django can be used to create web applications by creating my personal portfolio website.
